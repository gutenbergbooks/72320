<p>THE IDEAL BOOK OR BOOK BEAUTIFUL
is a composite thing made up of many parts &amp; may be
made beautiful by the beauty of each of its parts—its
literary content, its material or materials, its writing or
printing, its illumination or illustration, its binding &amp;
decoration—of each of its parts in subordination to the
whole which collectively they constitute: or it may be
made beautiful by the supreme beauty of one or more
of its parts, all the other parts subordinating or even
effacing themselves for the sake of this one or more, &amp;
each in turn being capable of playing this supreme part
and each in its own peculiar and characteristic way.
On the other hand each contributory craft may usurp
the functions of the rest &amp; of the whole and growing
beautiful beyond all bounds ruin for its own the common
cause. I propose in this brief essay, putting aside
for the moment the material, paper or vellum, the binding
&amp; decoration, &amp; the literary content of the Book
Beautiful, to say a few words on the artistic treatment
of the vehicle of expression—Calligraphy, Printing, &amp;
Illustration—and on the Book Beautiful as a whole.</p>

<h2>CALLIGRAPHY</h2>

<p>HANDWRITING and hand decoration of letter &amp;
page are at the root of the Book Beautiful, are at the
root of Typography &amp; of woodcut or engraved Decoration,
&amp; every printer, &amp; indeed every one having to
do with the making of books should ground himself
in the practice or knowledge of the Art of Beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Writing or Calligraphy, and let both hand and soul
luxuriate and rejoice for a while in the art of Illumination.
Such practice would keep Type alive under the
influence of an ever living &amp; fluent prototype. It would
supply a stock of exemplars &amp; suggestions from which
the Typographer might cautiously borrow, converting
into his own rigid stock such of the new beautiful
growths of Calligraphy as commended themselves to
him for the purpose.</p>

<p>¶ In the making of the Written Book, moreover, in
which various modes of presentment are combined,
symbolical and pictorial, the adjustment of letter to
letter, of word to word, of picture to text &amp; of text
to picture, and of the whole to the subject matter &amp;
to the page, admits of great nicety and perfection.
The type is fluid, and the letters and words, picture,
text, &amp; page are conceived of as one and are all executed
by one hand, or by several hands all working together
without intermediation on one identical page
and with a view to one identical effect. In the Printed
Book this adjustment is more difficult. The type is
rigid and implacable. The labour is divided and dispersed:
the picture or illustration, for example, is too
often done quite independently &amp; at a distance, without
thought of the printed page, &amp; inserted, a stranger,
amid an alien type. Yet in the making of the printed
book, as in the making of the written book, this
adjustment is essential, &amp; should be specially borne
in mind, and Calligraphy and immediate decoration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
by hand and the unity which should be inseparably
associated therewith would serve as an admirable discipline
to that end.</p>

<p>¶ Perhaps the most interesting things to note historically
in this connexion are (1) that all Calligraphy in
Italy, Spain, France, Germany &amp; England would seem
to be a development, with many subdivisions, of Roman
Calligraphy, itself a development of Greek, and
that the beautiful formation of the letters and their
orderly placement in sequence upon the rectangular
page are but modes of that general delight in the making
of order and beauty which is the note of unity
throughout all the arts: and (2) that in Calligraphy,
as in all the arts, a beauty of decoration once started
on its way, proceeds to throw off the conditions of its
birth and where it was meant to be only a minister
to make itself master. The stages in this usurpation
in the case of Calligraphy are singularly well marked
&amp; apparent. At the outset, Calligraphy was uniform
writing only, a succession of SQUARE CAPITALS
all of equal value. Then came the enlargement of the
sphere of action, so to speak, of letters in prominent positions,
of initial letters &amp; their decorative treatment:
then, in consequence of this very enlargement, a further
enlargement or emphasis which ended in ceasing
to be adjective decoration &amp; becoming a substantive
beauty, as of a picture, framed by the adjacent illumination
&amp; writing, but superior to them as the flower
to the leaf. Each of these stages has a beauty of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
own, and each in its turn constitutes a Book in some
sense a Beautiful Book. But in the passage from the
image created in the mind by abstract symbolism to
the image expressed on the page by verisimilitude, the
book itself underwent a change &amp; became in the process,
not a vehicle for the conveyance of an image, but
itself the image, to be appreciated not so much by the
imagination, the inner eye, as directly by the outer
eye, the sense of sight itself; just as on the stage the
scenery created at first imaginatively by the spectators,
in obedience to the influence of the actor, is now
presented externally by the scene painter &amp; costumier
in simulated reality. I apprehend that when the illuminator,
passing on from the decoration of significant
or initial letters, took to the making of pictures in this
fashion within the folds of them, he was pressing his
art too far. He was in danger, as the event showed, of
subordinating his Text to himself, of sacrificing the
thing signified to the mode of its signification, for in
the end the written communication became as it were
nothing, or but the framework or apology to support
a succession of beautiful pictures, beautiful indeed,
but beautiful at the expense of the Text which they
had set out to magnify.</p>

<p>¶ And we may in this connexion safely moralize &amp; say
that when many arts combine, or propose to combine,
to the making of one thing, as the process continues,
&amp; the several arts develop, each will attempt to assert
itself to the destruction of the one thing needful, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
the making of which they at first all combined in a
common subordination. Thus in our own case the illuminator
destroyed by over relative development the
purely written text, &amp; the moral is that every artist, in
contributing to the Book Beautiful, must keep himself
well in hand and strictly subordinate both his art
and his ambition to the end in view. He must remember
that in such a case his art is a means only &amp; not
itself an end.</p>

<p>¶ It is worthy of remark that the Church fought against
the idolatry of its Scribes, &amp; sought to curtail the
too exuberant beauty of their illuminators, &amp; a similar
attempt was made to keep down the idolatry of the
Binder. The Church has perhaps lost all pretension
even to influence in this respect. But artists should not
need the guidance of anything outside themselves as
artists. They should, as artists, realise that the world
of art is a commonweal, and that the most beautiful
art is a composite work, higher than the art of each,
and that the art of each is contributory, only to be
exercised in due subordination to the ideal which is
the creation of all.</p>

<h2>TYPOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>THE PASSAGE from the Written Book to the Printed
Book was sudden &amp; complete. Nor is it wonderful
that the earliest productions of the printing press are
the most beautiful &amp; that the history of its subsequent
career is but the history of its decadence. The Printer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
carried on into Type the tradition of the Calligrapher
&amp; of the Calligrapher at his best. As this tradition died
out in the distance, the craft of the Printer declined.
It is the function of the Calligrapher to revive &amp; restore
the craft of the Printer to its original purity of intention
&amp; accomplishment. The Printer must at the same
time be a Calligrapher, or in touch with him, &amp; there
must be in association with the Printing Press a Scriptorium
where beautiful writing may be practised and
the art of letter-designing kept alive. And there is this
further evidence of the dependence of printing upon
writing: the great revival in printing which is taking
place under our own eyes, is the work of a Printer who
before he was a Printer was a Calligrapher &amp; an Illuminator,
WILLIAM MORRIS.</p>

<p>¶ The whole duty of Typography, as of Calligraphy,
is to communicate to the imagination, without loss
by the way, the thought or image intended to be communicated
by the Author. And the whole duty of
beautiful typography is not to substitute for the beauty
or interest of the thing thought and intended to be
conveyed by the symbol, a beauty or interest of its
own, but, on the one hand, to win access for that communication
by the clearness &amp; beauty of the vehicle,
and on the other hand, to take advantage of every
pause or stage in that communication to interpose
some characteristic &amp; restful beauty in its own art. We
thus have a reason for the clearness and beauty of the
text as a whole, for the especial beauty of the first or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
introductory page and of the title, and for the especial
beauty of the headings of chapters, capital or initial
letters, &amp; so on, and an opening for the illustrator as
we shall see by and by.</p>

<p>¶ Further, in the case of Poetry, verse, in my opinion,
appeals by its form to the eye, as well as to the ear, &amp;
should be placed on the page so that its structure may
be taken in at a glance and distinctively appreciated,
and anything which interferes with this swiftness of
apprehension and appreciation, however beautiful in
itself, is in relation to the book as a whole a typographical
impertinence.</p>

<h2>ILLUSTRATION</h2>

<p>ILLUSTRATION, the other expressive constituent
of the Book Beautiful, is a part of the whole subject matter,
in process of symbolical communication, picked
out, isolated, &amp; presented pictorially. Besides its relation
in the field of the imagination to the rest of the subject
matter, the thought of the book, it has a relation
&amp; a most important relation, in the field of the senses,
to the vehicle of communication, the immediate typographical
environment, amid which it appears. And
here comes in the question, which has sometimes been
confused with the question of relationship, the question
of the mode in which the pictorial illustration
may be produced &amp; transferred to the page, by woodcut,
by steel or copper engraving, or by process. But
this seems to me to be an entirely subordinate though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
important question. The main question is the aspect
which the illustration shall be made to take in order
to fit it into and amid a page of Typography. And I
submit that its aspect must be essentially formal and
of the same texture, so to speak, as the letterpress. It
should have a set frame or margin to itself, demarcating
it distinctly from the text, and the shape &amp; character
of the frame, if decorative, should have relation to
the page as well as to the illustrative content; and the
illustrative content itself should be formal and kept
under so as literally to illustrate, and not to dim by
over brilliancy the rest of the subject matter left to be
communicated to the imagination by the letterpress
alone.</p>

<h2>THE BOOK BEAUTIFUL AS A WHOLE</h2>

<p>FINALLY, if the Book Beautiful may be beautiful by
virtue of its writing or printing or illustration, it may
also be beautiful, be even more beautiful, by the union
of all to the production of one composite whole, the
consummate Book Beautiful. Here the idea to be communicated
by the book comes first, as the thing of supreme
importance. Then comes in attendance upon
it, striving for the love of the idea to be itself beautiful,
the written or printed page, the decorated or decorative
letters, the pictures, set amid the text, and finally
the binding, holding the whole in its strong grip and
for very love again itself becoming beautiful because
in company with the idea.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<p>This is the supreme Book Beautiful or Ideal Book, a
dream, a symbol of the infinitely beautiful in which
all things of beauty rest and into which all things of
beauty do ultimately merge.</p>

<p>¶ The Book Beautiful, then, should be conceived of
as a whole, &amp; the self-assertion of any Art beyond the
limits imposed by the conditions of its creation should
be looked upon as an Act of Treason. The proper
duty of each Art within such limits is to co-operate
with all the other arts, similarly employed, in the production
of something which is distinctly Not-Itself.
The wholeness, symmetry, harmony, beauty without
stress or strain, of the Book Beautiful, would then be
one in principle with the wholeness, symmetry, harmony,
and beauty without stress or strain, of that
WHOLE OF LIFE WHICH IS CONSTITUTED
OF OURSELVES &amp; THE WORLD, THAT
COMPLEX AND MARVELLOUS WHOLE
WHICH, AMID THE STRIFE OF COMPETITIVE
FORCES, SUPREMELY HOLDS ITS
OWN, AND IN THE LANGUAGE OF LIFE
WRITES, UPON THE ILLUMINED PAGES
OF THE DAYS, THE VOLUMES OF THE
CENTURIES, &amp; THROUGH THE INFINITUDES
OF TIME &amp; SPACE MOVES RHYTHMICALLY
ONWARD TO THE FULL DEVELOPMENT
OF ITS ASTONISHING STORY
THE TRUE ARCHETYPE OF ALL BOOKS
BEAUTIFUL OR SUBLIME.</p>
